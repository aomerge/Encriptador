## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

The AES model is integrated to demonstrate symmetric key encryption, showcasing the process of encrypting and decrypting data using the same key. It highlights the efficiency and security provided by AES, making it a staple in digital security.

## RSA Encryption

Our RSA encryption example illustrates the workings of public-key cryptography, utilizing a pair of keys (public and private) for data encryption and decryption. This segment aims to deepen the understanding of asymmetric encryption and its applications.

## Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)

ECDH is featured as a key exchange protocol that allows secure key sharing over an insecure channel. This part of the project emphasizes the importance of secure communication in cryptographic systems.

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

ECC is presented to demonstrate the use of elliptic curves in public-key encryption. This example explores the efficiency and security advantages of ECC over traditional encryption methods, particularly in key generation and encryption.

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)

The DES section delves into symmetric-key algorithm encryption, focusing on the encryption of data in fixed-length blocks. It provides a basic understanding of how DES operates and its historical significance in cryptography.
